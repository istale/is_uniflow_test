# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the documentation framework for the Uniflow Calculation System. This involves setting up the memory bank files that will serve as the foundation for all future documentation and project understanding.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief documentation
- Established product context documentation
- Setting up system patterns and technical context

## Next Steps
- Complete system patterns documentation
- Document technical context and dependencies
- Update progress tracking
- Review and validate all documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Adopting a modular architecture approach with separate operation modules
- Using registry pattern for operation management
- Following pipeline execution model for complex calculations
- Maintaining consistent API across all operation types

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Registry-based operation management
- Pipeline orchestration for multi-step calculations
- Extensible architecture that allows easy addition of new operations

## Learnings and Project Insights
The project demonstrates a clean separation between operation types (addition, multiplication, division) and a clear pipeline execution flow. This modular approach makes the system easy to understand and extend.
