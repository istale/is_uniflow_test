# Progress

## What Works
- Complete project structure with modular design
- All memory bank documentation files created
- Clear separation of concerns between operation types
- Well-defined system patterns and architecture
- Consistent technical context and development setup

## What's Left to Build
- Implementation of actual arithmetic operations in modules
- Pipeline execution functionality
- Registry pattern implementation
- Integration testing between components

## Current Status
Initial documentation phase complete. Memory bank files are established and provide comprehensive overview of the project structure and design decisions.

## Known Issues
- No actual implementation code present in the modules yet
- Pipeline execution logic needs to be implemented
- Registry functionality needs to be developed

## Evolution of Project Decisions
The project has evolved from a simple idea into a well-documented modular system. The decision to use separate modules for each arithmetic operation has proven to be a good approach for maintainability and extensibility.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the actual arithmetic operation logic in each module
2. Develop the registry pattern functionality
3. Build the pipeline execution system
4. Create integration tests
5. Document any implementation details that weren't covered in the initial documentation
