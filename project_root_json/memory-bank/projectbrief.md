# Project Brief

## Project Name
Uniflow Calculation System

## Core Purpose
A modular arithmetic calculation system with registry, addition, multiplication, and division modules that work together in a pipeline architecture.

## Key Features
- Modular design with separate packages for different arithmetic operations
- Registry pattern for operation management
- Pipeline execution system for coordinated calculations
- Extensible architecture for adding new operations

## Target Users
Developers working with calculation pipelines and modular arithmetic systems

## Project Scope
This system provides a foundation for building complex calculation workflows through well-defined modules that can be composed together in various ways to perform mathematical operations.
