# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.x
- **Architecture**: Modular Python packages
- **Design Patterns**: Registry, Pipeline, Strategy, Module patterns
- **Development Tools**: Standard Python development environment

## Development Setup
- Python virtual environment recommended
- Standard Python package structure
- No external dependencies specified in the basic structure
- Modular design allows for easy testing of individual components

## Technical Constraints
- All operation modules must follow the same interface contract
- Registry must be able to discover and load operations dynamically
- Pipeline execution must handle errors gracefully
- Each module should be independently testable

## Dependencies
- Standard Python libraries only (no external dependencies)
- Python 3.6+ compatibility
- Modular package structure for easy import and usage

## Tool Usage Patterns
- Python modules organized in separate directories for each operation type
- Registry pattern implementation for operation discovery
- Pipeline execution flow through invoker module
- Consistent function signatures across all arithmetic operations

## Code Organization
- `a01_registry/` - Registry implementation
- `b02_addition/` - Addition operation implementation  
- `b03_multiply/` - Multiplication operation implementation
- `b04_divide/` - Division operation implementation
- `c01_invoker/` - Pipeline execution orchestrator
- `c02_calculation/` - Core calculation logic
- `c03_more_calculation/` - Extended calculation pipeline
